# L Dettling
Hello! Here are at least 3 bullet points describing my interests (either personal, technical, or research-related):
- I am scuba-certified, and really enjoy scuba diving in Lake Michigan. It's a very peaceful hobby.
- I have started to learn more about Node, and I am really enjoying it so far. I have begun to watch tutorial videos outside of class and my brain is connecting really well with the concepts.
- I enjoy researching mechanical engineering problems, and the VERY nice connection between computational geometry and mechanical engineering. 


## Technicnal Background 
I have primarily worked with Java, Python, and Julia. I have exposure to C, C++, and JavaScript (I am hoping to know more javascript by the end of this course). I am skilled in Microsoft's Power BI and Power Automate, and I currently do a lot of data analysis and reporting for my current role at the university.



I have roating favorite meme's. I am trying to 100% Tears of the Kindgom, so see [here](https://preview.redd.it/totk-one-of-the-hardest-battles-in-the-game-v0-ec445feszgmb1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f556d62e18f4b4959539bebee6efcd08fae0929c) to learn about my very first reaction to a Gleeok.
